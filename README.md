The otp_field package for Flutter allows you to easily create OTP input fields in your app. This package supports a range of features, including:

Customizable Input Length: Developers can define the number of OTP digits based on the application's requirements.

Auto-Focus and Auto-Submit: Once a user enters a digit, the cursor automatically moves to the next field, providing a smooth user experience. Additionally, the field can automatically submit the OTP once all fields are filled.

Flexible Styling: The package allows for custom styling, including input field borders, text colors, background colors, and more, enabling you to match the OTP field design with the overall app theme.

Input Validation: Built-in validation ensures that users can only input digits, making it a secure and intuitive solution for OTP entry.

Keyboard Handling: The package also supports keyboard optimizations, such as hiding the keyboard automatically after OTP submission.

With its intuitive design and flexibility, the otp_field package is an essential tool for Flutter developers looking to implement seamless OTP verification features in their mobile apps.
